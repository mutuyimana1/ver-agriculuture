                        <p className='text-center pl-2 xl:pl-60 pb-20'>Deforestation is a very big problem in developing countries include Rwanda, 70.2% of the Rwanda population lives in the rural areas parts of the country most of the part depends on charcoal and fuel-wood for fuel supply which requires cutting of forest this one causes a reduction in forest products a reduction in environmental services such as soil protection and damage to biodiversity.     Consequently, access to tree products (timber, poles, fodder and fruits), food security, climate change, and diseases is a serious problem in sub-Saharan Africa and particularly in rural areas of Rwanda caused by deforestation.

                            This project aims to support community vulnerable with limited or no access to good livelihoods in the generating the income opportunities this is will facilitate reduction of all dependence to forest.</p>
